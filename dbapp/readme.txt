Code to go into the folder!

What started as a tutorial video turns into raw coding after getting an unexpected AV within the IDE, and then when I accidently add a js (?) related component onto the form, all hell breaks loose! This is what happens sometimes... regardless of whether you are a developer (professional or not) or when trying to make a tutorial video.
