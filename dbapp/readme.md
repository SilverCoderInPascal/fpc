# Vehicle Lookup DB App

What started as a tutorial video turns into raw coding after getting an unexpected AV within the IDE, and then when I accidently add a js (?) related component onto the form, all hell breaks loose! This is what happens sometimes... regardless of whether you are a developer (professional or not) or when trying to make a tutorial video.

## Database
The database (mydatabase.db) is needed, and you will need to change the path to the database (in the database connection component within the datamodule) if you want to actually run the program.
